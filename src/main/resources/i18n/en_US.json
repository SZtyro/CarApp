      "ABOUT_ME":{
        "DESCRIPTION": "My name is Fabian, and for the past five years, I've been developing and enhancing ERP and CRM applications using Java EE and Angular. I have in-depth knowledge of Angular - I started with migrating legacy projects from AngularJS. I independently designed and maintain two libraries that accelerate software development, automate form handling, and help prevent errors. I've worked with companies across various industries - from large enterprises to sole proprietorships. I've implemented process optimizations (Kaizen, FMEA), worked with PostgreSQL, Git, and Jira, and developed Android applications. In my free time, I work on personal projects using Spring Boot - one of which I host on my own VPS, where I also explore Linux and Docker.",
        "DESCRIPTION_2": "When building applications, I pay close attention to scalability. I believe that every feature might need to be extended in the future, so careful architectural planning from the start is essential. I strive to make my code clean, readable, and easy to maintain. I avoid unnecessary duplication of logic. I create libraries with reusability in mind - as a solid foundation for future projects, helping me save time when starting new applications. I also enjoy experimenting with design. Despite the limited support for Material Design 3 in Angular, I actively work on implementing it in my projects.",
        "FOOTER": "Besides programming, I enjoy playing video games. My favorite is Space Engineers - a sandbox game where I'm limited only by my imagination, not a storyline. It also allows writing simple scripts in C#, which adds another layer of fun for me. I'm also passionate about emerging technologies and aviation. In the future, I'd love to create my own video game."
